# Queue

Queue is an abstract data type or a linear data structure, just like stack data structure, in which the first element is inserted from one end called the REAR(also called tail), and the removal of existing element takes place from the other end called as FRONT(also called head).

A real-world example of queue can be the ticket queue outside a cinema hall, where the first person entering the queue is the first person who gets the ticket.

 Queue follows **First-In-First-Out(FIFO)** methodology, i.e., the data item stored first will be accessed first. The process to add an element into queue is called Enqueue and the process of removal of an element from queue is called Dequeue.
